# Linux-kernel-developer-roadmap-

1. Fundamental Knowledge

Learn C Programming: The Linux kernel is written in C (with some assembly). Master C, including advanced concepts like pointers, memory management, bitwise operations, and data structures.
Basics of Operating Systems: Understand OS concepts: processes, memory management, scheduling, interrupts, filesystems, synchronization, and concurrency.
Linux Command Line: Get comfortable with bash, file manipulation, text processing, and scripting.

2. Deep Dive Into Linux

Linux Internals: Study Linux architecture, boot process, system calls, kernel space vs user space, and device drivers.
Kernel Source Code: Download and explore the Linux kernel source code. Understand its structure: /arch, /drivers, /fs, /kernel, /mm, etc.
Kernel Compilation: Learn to configure, compile, and boot a custom kernel.

3. Development Environment

Setup Environment: Use a virtual machine and/or QEMU for kernel testing. Familiarize yourself with git for version control.
Debugging Tools: Learn gdb, kgdb, ftrace, perf, and kernel debugging techniques (printk, dynamic debug, etc.).

4. Key Kernel Subsystems

Process Management: Study task_struct, scheduling algorithms, and process lifecycle.
Memory Management: Understand struct page, buddy allocator, slab/slub allocators, virtual memory, paging, mm subsystem.
Filesystems: Learn about VFS, ext4, and how filesystems are implemented.
Device Drivers: Write simple character and block drivers. Study driver models, probe/remove methods, udev.

5. Contributing to the Kernel

Coding Standards: Follow Linux coding style.
Patch Submission: Learn how to generate patches (git format-patch), send them (git send-email), and participate in mailing lists.
Bug Reporting & Fixing: Pick beginner bugs, study their code, and try to fix.

6. Advanced Topics

Synchronization: Spinlocks, semaphores, atomic operations, RCU.
Interrupts: IRQ handling, softirqs, tasklets, bottom halves.
Networking: Network stack, sockets, netfilter.
Security: SELinux, capabilities, kernel security mechanisms.

Projects 

1-Beginner Projects

Write a Simple Kernel Module

Create a basic "Hello World" kernel module that logs messages to the kernel ring buffer.
Character Device Driver

Develop a simple character device driver that allows reading/writing data from/to a device file.
Sysfs Interface

Add a sysfs entry to expose kernel parameters or internal states to user space.

2-Intermediate Projects

Custom System Call

Implement a new system call in the Linux kernel and expose it to user space.
Process Scheduler Modification

Experiment with the Linux scheduler by adjusting scheduling policies or priorities.
Memory Management Enhancements

Modify or optimize a part of the kernelâ€™s memory management (e.g., slab allocator).
Virtual Filesystem (VFS) Module

Write a simple filesystem module using the VFS interface.

3-Advanced Projects

Network Protocol Implementation

Implement a simple network protocol (e.g., a custom transport protocol) in the kernel.
Tracing and Profiling Tools

Extend or create kernel tracing/profiling tools (e.g., using ftrace, perf, or BPF).
Security Module

Develop a Linux Security Module (LSM) for custom access control.
Work on Upstream Kernel Bugs or Features
